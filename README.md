# Movie series (p)review

----
## A voice-driven Alexa skill 
> Built with [Flask-Ask](http://flask-ask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for [Amazon Echo](https://twitter.com/amazonecho)

This is a ridiculously simple skill that lets you discover movie metadata for the [Friday the 13th series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Friday_the_13th_(franchise)_films) (or any other collection of films...just change the IMDb IDs).

----
## See it in action
[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8GNlB6VKWM) of me using the service - with the invocation phrase to launch the skill and the voice model to tell Alexa which film in the Friday the 13th series to profile.

----
## Invocation
1. to launch the skill, say *Alexa, launch Camp Crystal Lake tour guide*
2. when prompted, [say which sequel](https://github.com/jasonsalas/Alexa-movie-series-previewer/blob/master/speech_assets/sample_utterances.txt) in the series you're most interested in
