# Movie series (p)review

----
## A voice-driven Alexa skill 
> Built with [Flask-Ask](http://flask-ask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for [Amazon Echo](https://twitter.com/amazonecho)

This is a ridiculously simple skill that lets you discover movie metadata for the [Friday the 13th series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Friday_the_13th_(franchise)_films) (or any other collection of films..just change the IMDb IDs).

----
## Invocation
1. to launch the skill, say *Alexa, launch Camp Crystal Lake tour guide*
2. when prompted, say which sequel in the series you're most interested in

## Run it yourself
